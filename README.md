# ‚õ±Ô∏è AirBnB Clone Project - The Console
![hbnb](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91517809/176107896-998e3280-f565-4e09-a801-c609984bfed6.png)

This console is the first part of the AirBnB project at the Holberton school.
This program will cover some fundamental concepts of higher level programming
that we have gone over in our curriculum. The goal of this project is to deploy
a simple clone of the AirBnB website. A command interpreter has been created
to manage objects for the website.

## üå≥ Environment:
This project has been completed on Ubuntu 20.04 using python3 (3.8.5)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

> Step 1 - Clone the repo locally using this command
```
gh repo clone chiaracaprasi/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
```
> Step 2 - Navigate to the folder
```
cd holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone
```
> Step 3 - Run the console shell in interactive mode:
```
./console.py
```
> Step 4 - Type a command e.g.
```
(hbnb) help
```
> Step 5 - Exit the shell
```
(hbnb) quit
```

## üöÄ Operation Modes

#### Interactive mode
In the interactive mode, the console will display (hbnb) prompting the user to type in and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt (hbnb) will appear again in a new line waiting for a new command to be entered. As long as the user doesn't quit the shell (by typing quit and pressing enter), this will go indefinitely. 
Example:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

#### Non-interactive mode

In the non-interactive mode, the console is run with a command pipped into into its execution - this way the command is run as soon as the shell starts. In this mode no prompt (hbnb) appears, and no further input is expected from the user.
Example:

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```



## üõÇ Testing:
All files, classes and functions can be tested with unit tests.

**Interactive mode:** 
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

**Non-interactive mode** 
```
echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
```



## üìÅ File descriptions:

### [console.py](console.py)
The console contains the entry point of the interpreter, the list of commands
the interpreter supports are as follows:
* `EOF` - exits console
* `quit` - exits console
* `create` - Creates a new instance of`BaseModel`, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id
* `destroy` - Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). 
* `show` - Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id.
* `all` - Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. 
* `update` - Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). 


### [base_model.py](/models/base_model.py)
The BaseModel class is the class which future classes will inherit from.
* `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` - Initialization of the base model
* `def __str__(self)` - String representation of the BaseModel class
* `def save(self)` - Updates the attribute `updated_at` with the current datetime
* `def to_dict(self)` - returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of the instance

### [file_storage.py](/models/engine/file_storage.py)
The file_storage file serializes instances to a JSON file & deserializes back to instances
* `def all(self)` - returns the dictionary __objects
* `def new(self, obj)` - sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
* `def save(self)` - serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
* ` def reload(self)` -  deserializes the JSON file to __objects

## üõñ Examples

$ ./console.py

(hbnb)

(hbnb) BaseModel.create()
